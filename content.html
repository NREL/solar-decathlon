<h3>What is the Solar Decathlon?</h3>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon challenges collegiate teams to design, build, and operate solar-powered houses that are affordable, energy-efficient, and attractive. The winner of the competition is the team that best blends cost-effectiveness, consumer appeal, and design excellence with optimal energy production and maximum efficiency. </p>

<p>The first Solar Decathlon was held in <a href="/past/2002/">2002</a>; the competition has since occurred biennially in <a href="/past/2005/">2005</a>, <a href="/past/2007/">2007</a>, <a href="/past/2009/">2009</a>, <a href="/past/2011/">2011</a>, and <a href="/past/2013/">2013</a>. The next Solar Decathlon will take place in October 2015 at the Orange County Great Park in Irvine, California. <a href="/apply.html">Plan your visit</a>. </p>



<h3>Who competes in the Solar Decathlon?</h3>
<p><a href="/2015/competition-teams.html">Teams</a> from colleges and universities across the globe participate in the Solar Decathlon. Today's students are tomorrow's engineers, architects, scientists, entrepreneurs, and homeowners. The Solar Decathlon encourages students to incorporate energy efficiency and clean energy into their future professional projects and personal lives.</p>

<p>Like Olympic athletes, the solar decathletes draw on all their strengths, including design and architecture, engineering and performance, and education and promotion. The teams rely on expertise from many disciplines as they spend months fundraising, planning, designing, analyzing, and finally building and improving their houses. Future engineers work with future architects to create affordable, energy-efficient houses.</p>



<h3>How are the competitors selected?</h3>
<p>Teams composed of faculty and students from post-secondary institutions submit proposals and plans for consideration. Applications are evaluated by a panel of engineers, scientists, and building experts. Teams are required to meet specific criteria to demonstrate their ability to design and build an innovative, entirely solar-powered house; raise funds; support the project through well-integrated curricula; and assemble a team to carry the project through to completion. In addition, a panel of professionals evaluates conceptual designs from proposers. The results of their evaluations, combined with scores based on the four criteria listed above, determine the Solar Decathlon teams.</p>

<p>If you are interested in competing in a future Solar Decathlon, <a href="/about-apply.html">learn how to apply</a>. </p>



<h3>How many teams apply?</h3>
<p>Selected teams can be proud that they are among a select group of schools and students to take part in the unique educational and workforce development opportunity that is the Solar Decathlon. However, per federal requirements, the number of applications received is confidential.</p>



<h3>What goes into building and operating a Solar Decathlon house?</h3>
<p>The student teams spend almost two years designing and building their houses and preparing for the competition. Students test their houses to ensure optimal energy production and maximum efficiency. </p>

<p>The competition places demands on the buildings' energy systems to maintain the house within a certain temperature range, to provide lighting, to run appliances, and much more. The houses generate energy with photovoltaic (also called solar electric) systems that produce electricity and with solar thermal systems for space heating and cooling and water heating. </p>

</ul>



<h3>How much do the houses cost?</h3>
<p>The construction costs of the team houses vary based on the technologies employed and the target market for which they were designed. In 2011, the Solar Decathlon introduced a new contest—Affordability—that rewards full points for teams that build houses with costs estimated at or less than $250,000. In this way, the Solar Decathlon showcases affordable houses that combine energy-efficient construction and appliances with renewable energy systems available today.</p>


<h3>What happens to the houses after the competition?</h3>
<p>Some of the houses are sold to recover costs or raise money for future teams. Most of the houses, however, are used for research and are on display for <a href="/house_tours.html">public tours</a> at their respective universities.

<p>Its public and private "wings" are serviced by an active "core" that contains mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and monitoring systems. The private wing includes a master bedroom and a flexible library/office/second bedroom. The public wing contains entertainment and dining spaces that open to exterior areas and the views beyond.</p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>Interactive. Intuitive. Integrated. This is Cal Poly's interpretation of net-zero. INhouse explores the connection between system and resident with the goal of making operation and management intuitive, energy-affordable, and waste-minimal. INhouse is a manifestation of Cal Poly's core directive: Learn by Doing. </p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Through use of a folding window-wall, the public module blends into a generous outdoor area, doubling the public space. </li>

    <li>The walls and roof of the public and private modules are made of structural insulated panels (SIPs), which offer higher R-values and faster construction than traditional materials.</li>

    <li>The elongation of the house along the east-west axis takes advantage of passive solar design principles to harness and control southern solar exposure while minimizing overheating on the east and west sides. </li>

    <li>INhouse harnesses solar energy through conventional photovoltaic panels, solar thermal water collectors, and bifacial panels.</li>

    <li>A constructed wetlands system cleans and recycles all the greywater the house produces and directs it to be used for landscape irrigation. </li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A standard air duct contains bio-based phase-change material, a non-food palm oil, that absorbs and releases heat to passively cool or heat the house and reduce the need for the HVAC system.</li>

    <li>A translucent roof of bifacial solar panels over the patio blends indoor and outdoor space by creating a shady extension of the living space. </li>

    <li>A central low-power server collects data from built-in temperature, humidity, power generation, and power use sensors and feeds it to a smart home app, which outlines data on the occupant's smartphone or tablet and makes it possible to apply data-mining techniques to reduce energy use.  </li>

    <li>A simple control application enables the occupant to monitor, manage, and personalize the luminous and thermal environment.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>INhouse is designed for a couple or an individual with a willingness to interact with and adapt to the net-zero philosophy—to learn by doing—in coastal California. Although Cal Poly could have designed a house that operates independent of its residents, it believes a "smart home" is of less value to society than a "smart resident." </p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>After Solar Decathlon 2015, one possibility for INhouse is that it return to the Cal Poly campus to be used as student housing. There, residents would be encouraged to learn how to live net-zero, with the house itself the vehicle for their education. The team would continue to monitor its performance.</p>

<h1>Clemson: Clemson University</h1>

<p>Team website: <a href="http://indigopine.com/">www.indigopine.com</a></p>

<p>Indigo Pine, the first U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon entry from Clemson University, seeks to improve the sustainability of construction socially, economically, and environmentally. The Clemson team developed a new construction method to enable residents to construct their own homes efficiently and affordably. Using this method, the plans for Indio Pine will be emailed to California and fabricated there, allowing all products to be locally sourced, reducing the project's carbon footprint, and demonstrating the flexibility of the design around the globe. </p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>The Clemson team focused on stitching together innovative building methods, Southern personality, and local products into a family home. Indigo Pine's innovative building method emphasizes front-end design to make construction faster, safer, and more intuitive by using materials that can be purchased from any supply store. By streamlining and simplifying the construction process, Indigo Pine can be built largely by the homeowners. In addition, Indigo Pine has global application. Because the house exists largely as a set of digital files, the plans can be sent anywhere in the world, constructed using local materials, adapted to the site, and influenced by local culture. </p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Indigo Pine focuses attention on its common space to promote interaction and community. </li>

    <li>The innovative Sim[PLY] structural system, coupled with simple finishes and systems, enables an average person to construct the house by using only hand-powered tools,. </li>

    <li>Interior cabinets, which serve as partitions, optimize space within the house by increasing storage. </li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Clemson created a unique framing system, called Sim[PLY], in which each component is individually numbered, flat-packed, and shipped to the building site to be assembled in a three-dimensional puzzle.</li>

    <li>Similar to mortise-and-tenon construction, Sim[PLY] components lock together with a tab-and-slot connection secured by stainless steel zip ties. </li>

    <li>The foundation is made of concrete masonry units to form a "concrete lung" that encourages air to flow through the space and serves as a regulating mass to cool or warm air passing through. </li>

    <li>A unique solar hot water system heats water directly with five solar panels to reduce energy loss.</li>
</ul>



INSERT VIDEO PLAYER



<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>Clemson designed Indigo Pine for a Southern family of four. The 1,000-ft2 house includes three bedrooms, a unique bathroom, and a large common space for family events. Its structural system allows for uninhibited open space, allowing the family to customize the interior layout and adapt it over time. In line with typical Southern homes, Indigo Pine features a front porch—the perfect place to spend a quiet evening with family, get together with friends, or have a glass of sweet tea on a summer afternoon.</p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>Clemson University is building two houses. Indigo Pine East will remain in Clemson, and Indigo Pine West will compete in Solar Decathlon 2015 in Irvine, California. Indigo Pine East will remain onsite in Clemson, where students and faculty will use it as a research base, and visitors will be invited to learn about its innovation, until December 2015. Although the team does not have definitive plans for either house after this time, it hopes to continue its research initiatives well after the competition.</p>

<h1>Crowder/Drury: Crowder College and Drury University</h1>

<p>Team website: <a href="http://shelter.drury.edu/">shelter.drury.edu</a></p>

<p>ShelteR3, Crowder College and Drury University's U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2015 entry, is a disaster-resilient house designed to be both elegantly simple and secure. Its name alludes to the most fundamental purpose of a home—to provide shelter—and the team's design philosophy: Respond, Recover, and Resist. ShelteR3 (pronounced "shelter cubed") will not only accelerate the recovery of those affected by tornadoes but also counter the effects of future disasters.</p>

<p>Crowder College previously competed in <a href="/past/2002/team_crowder.html">Solar Decathlon 2002</a> and <a href="/past/2005/team_crowder.html">Solar Decathlon 2005</a>. It joins forces with Drury University for the first time in Solar Decathlon 2015.</p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>R3—Respond, Recover, Resist—is the guiding philosophy of ShelteR3. In the aftermath of a tornado, ShelteR3 can be quickly transported and installed in two modules. Fully equipped with amenities such as a kitchen, bath, living spaces, and independent power facilities for heating and lighting, it can function as a disaster response command center or disaster relief housing. </p>

<p>ShelteR3's open living area expands to a spacious front porch and semiprivate rear deck. Minimal window openings in the bedrooms, kitchen, and bath create privacy and secure protection. The rooftop solar power system and energy-efficient appliances ensure independent energy. Finally, the ultra-strong core, strengthened by walls of multiple layers of shielding, is further enveloped by an unyielding fence that deflects projectiles in high winds.</p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>ShelteR3 can withstand substantial impacts and wind loads, allowing it to resist tornadic storms. </li>

    <li>A multi-layered wall assembly of sheathing, polycarbonate and fiber cement cladding, and an enveloping impact-resistant fence makes the house formidably strong and intelligently elegant.</li>

    <li>The frames and glass of the doors and windows are hurricane-rated. </li>

    <li>An outer set of shielding doors close down in high winds to protect the living area. </li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A frame of 2-by-6 wood studs spaced at 12 inches on center instead of standard 2-by-4 studs spaced at 16 inches makes the house stronger than traditional houses of similar materials. </li>

    <li>A steel chassis connected by 1/2-inch vertical rods 4 feet on center anchor the roof securely to the foundation to aid in wind resistance. </li>

    <li>The 5/8-inch wall and floor sheathing creates a weather-tight water barrier that is glued and screwed to wood studs at every 3 inches. </li>

    <li>A 14-kW solar energy system uses an array of 36 photovoltaic panels.</li>
</ul>

INSERT VIDEO PLAYER



<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>ShelteR3 is designed for a family of two adults and a child living in a tornado-prone area. Configurable as either easily deployable disaster-relief housing or an expanded, permanent, tornado-resistant home, ShelteR3 can serve three markets: disaster response, relief, and pre-disaster resistance. </p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>Joplin, Missouri, was an inspiration for the Crowder/Drury team, and the team hopes ShelteR3 is able to serve the city directly. ShelteR3 serves as a demonstration home, exemplifying sustainable living and embodying disaster resilience in a new green neighborhood. Ideally, the team hopes organizations such as AmeriCorps, the American Red Cross, and FEMA embrace and incorporate the design into disaster response command centers or the mass production of disaster relief housing.</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>The Solar Living House is a house for living. It centers on people and the activities of daily life while introducing advanced design, construction, and engineering technologies. The house is a modular, two-bedroom one-bath home that embraces and frames an exterior courtyard, which acts as an extension of the interior space and introduces natural light. Innovative solar thermal systems control humidity, increase comfort, improve air quality, and reduce energy use.</p>

<p>Inspired by mid-century modern homes and the Case Study House program, the Florida/Singapore team approached the Solar Living House with the goal of creating an elegant and disciplined house that expresses its construction in an honest and direct manner—a house that basks in the sun and harnesses the full extent of the energy it affords and that reflects the poetic delight of a bygone era, updated and transformed through technological prowess. </p>



<h2>Technologies</h2>


<ul>
<li>A wet core consolidates the mechanical systems and bathroom into a single module to reduce plumbing runs, efficiency losses, and on-site construction time. </li>

    <li>An integrated building automation system allows the environmental systems, lights, security systems, and smoke detectors to be programmed, monitored, and controlled through any mobile or computing device. </li>

    <li>Two rooftop evacuated-tube solar thermal collectors generate hot water that is used to dry a regenerative solid desiccant material, typically white silica gel, that adsorbs moisture and humidity from the air in a solar thermal dehumidification system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just as birds use materials from their environment to build a nest, Missouri University of Science and Technology reused common materials to build its U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2015 entry. Three refurbished shipping containers form the structure of the house. Innovative technologies such as greywater reclamation and a home automation system pair with passive design techniques to reduce overall energy consumption and improve efficiency. Collectively, these elements form a balanced blend of modern design, comfort, and sustainability.</p>

<p>The Missouri University of Science and Technology previously competed in <a href="/past/2002/team_rolla.html">Solar Decathlon 2002</a>, <a href="/past/2005/team_rolla.html">Solar Decathlon 2005</a>, <a href="/past/2007/team_rolla.html">Solar Decathlon 2007</a>, <a href="/past/2009/team_missouri.html">Solar Decathlon 2009</a>, and <a href="/past/2013/team_missouri.html">Solar Decathlon 2013</a>.</p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>The Nest Home is designed to prove that a net-zero home can comfortably and reliably meet the needs of a small family. Repurposed materials are used throughout for affordability and to extend their lifecycle. Three decommissioned shipping containers are set around a central gathering space to create a deconstructed triangle inspired by the shape of a bird's nest. The floor plan promotes togetherness while providing room for privacy. Wood siding reclaimed from shipping pallets shields the exterior, while carpeting made of reprocessed fishing nets covers the floor. Recycled denim batting in the interior walls provides insulation.</p>

<p>The Nest Home demonstrates the affordability of sustainable design and smart living through integrated systems. A greywater system gathers water from showers to reduce water consumption by up to 25%. A home automation system monitors interior and exterior conditions to make appropriate, and even predictive, adjustments to the HVAC system, interior lighting, and windows. Finally, hydroponic gardens provide residents with fresh produce year-round. </p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A greywater reclamation system treats water from the bathroom sink, shower, and laundry for reuse throughout the house and as source water in a garden or hydroponic system. </li>

    <li>Three hydroponic gardens provide controlled environments to produce fresh vegetables and herbs.</li>

    <li>DIY projects—including planter boxes made from shipping pallets, bathroom tile trim made from reclaimed ceramic fragments, and a concrete countertop inlaid with recycled glass—give new life to materials.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>An array of 24 PV panels powers the house and an electric vehicle. Each panel contains a micro-inverter to eliminate the need for a centralized inverter and transform direct current to alternating current at the source. </li>

    <li>Automated windows can be programmed to respond to changing conditions and support the HVAC system. </li>

    <li>A home automation system automatically turns lights off when the home is empty and uses light harvesting technology to dim or brighten lights in real time as needed.</li>
</ul>

INSERT VIDEO PLAYER



<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>The Nest Home is built for the needs of a growing family. The intimate floorplan is conducive to family-friendly activities, while the deconstructed geometry of the living space allows occupants to enjoy privacy when they wish. The main structure can be expanded by adding more containers to provide more space as the family grows. Comfort and convenience is assured for all stages of family life—from a full nest to an empty nest.</p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>Team website: <a href="http://www.solarnest.org/">www.solarnest.org</a></p>

<p>The California State University, Sacramento, team calls its first U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon project Reflect Home because the house is intended to reflect those who live within it. The Reflect Home is a model of sustainable—yet stylish and comfortable—living. It allows the homeowner to generate and use power in a way that leaves a smaller footprint on the planet without sacrificing the comforts and conveniences of a modern, affordable home. </p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>The Reflect Home's design is focused on the resident, with the intention of making the house as functional, livable, and comfortable as possible. The Sacramento State team believes net-zero design will achieve widespread application only when homebuyers realize that sustainability can be achieved without sacrificing accommodations. Inspiration for the exterior is drawn from Sacramento's Craftsman bungalows and small mid-century ranch homes. </p>

<p>The interior includes an open and modern common space with an emphasis on indoor-outdoor living. The continuous wall and ceiling materials break down the barrier between indoors and out, while the outdoor living area offers a large space for living and entertaining. Balancing this sense of openness is a recognizably domestic private sphere that respects traditional patterns of family life. The second bedroom features a sliding wall. When opened, it can be used as an office or playroom. The primary bedroom features a private outdoor room connected by a folding exterior wall. </p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A rain-collecting water feature on the back patio cascades rainwater from the roof to produce soothing sounds that bring life and motion to the backyard.</li>

    <li>A living wall is functional as a vertical garden, offers protection from UV rays, and acts as a cooling mechanism while serving as living art.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>An air-to-water heat pump conditions the inside space in a process that is 80% more efficient than a typical heating and cooling system and 25 times quieter than a traditional air-conditioning unit.</li>

    <li>Advanced framing techniques reduce the number of studs required and increase the walls' aggregate R-value while maintaining structural integrity. </li>

    <li>High-density blown insulation within the wall cavities further increases the shell's thermal resistance. </li>

    <li>Sealing of the top plates, sills, and penetrations through the super structure eliminates uncontrolled air transfer in and out of the structure envelope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>Reflect Home's target client is a millennial family. A maturing generation, millennials are likely buying a home first time and want a home that supports their sustainable lifestyle while comfortably supporting their families. In Sacramento, the areas that attract young families most are smaller, older homes in established neighborhoods. </p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>After Solar Decathlon 2015, the Reflect Home will return to campus in conjunction with Sacramento State's Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center. There, it will serve as a working lab for students to learn about home construction and net-zero design. In addition, tours will show community members improvements they can make in their own homes and inspire ideas for better, more cost-effective, and innovative homes.</p>

<p>Team website: <a href="http://surehouse.org/">www.surehouse.org</a></p>

<p>Stevens Institute of Technology started with a simple question when preparing for the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2015: "How can we design a home that both reduces energy use and adapts to the realities of a changing, more extreme climate?" The answer is the SURE (sustainable + resilient) HOUSE, a high-performance, solar-powered house that is armored against extreme weather and can provide emergency power in the aftermath of a storm—packaged as a comfortable, beautiful shore house.</p>

<p>Stevens Institute of Technology previously competed in <a href="/past/2011/team_parsons_stevens.html">Solar Decathlon 2011</a> and <a href="/past/2013/team_stevens.html">Solar Decathlon 2013</a>.   </p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>The storm surge, high winds, and flooding associated with 2012's Superstorm Sandy highlighted the vulnerability of Mid-Atlantic shore neighborhoods. The SURE HOUSE therefore began with a simple idea: create a low-energy, solar-powered, storm-resilient home for vulnerable coastal communities. The notion of the "shore house" resulted in a focus on indoor-outdoor spaces, and through a simple design transformation, the SURE HOUSE doubles its usable space in the summer months by opening up to the outdoor decks. This outdoor living room complements a contemporary interior that draws on natural daylight and flexible living space to create an inviting family home.</p>

<p>The SURE HOUSE is based on three principles: use less energy through smart design, generate all energy needed through renewable solar electric, and be capable of providing power during electrical outages. </p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A storm-rugged PV system supplies power when in the grid is down without the use of batteries. </li>

    <li>Working with local topography such as dunes, the SURE HOUSE can be raised slightly to avoid periodic nuisance flooding and encapsulate vital building systems in a storm-resistant shell. </li>

    <li>Thick insulation and rigorous air-sealing mean the SURE HOUSE is less sensitive to outdoor temperature swings and remains clean, safe, healthy, and comfortable inside.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>An "islanding" PV array produces energy even when the utility grid is damaged or disconnected, powering the house and allowing neighbors to charge their electronic devices via exterior USBs.</li>

    <li>The SURE HOUSE exceeds Passive House standards for energy use through the use of dense insulation, rigorous air sealing, smart construction techniques, and high-performance windows, </li>

    <li>Architecturally integrated, fiber-composite shutters on the southern façade provide passive solar control and house integrated PV panels when up and lock into the structure with a watertight seal when down. </li>

    <li>A hybrid heat pump hot water tank accepts DC power directly from the PV system to allow it to function without grid power.</li>
</ul>

INSERT VIDEO PLAYER



<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>The New York and New Jersey shores are home to tight-knit neighborhoods of residents who represent the target market for the SURE HOUSE. Designed with a middle-class family in mind, the SURE HOUSE represents a new direction in living for coastal shore housing by providing a safe, secure, comfortable, and architecturally innovative home. The two bedrooms and flexible living spaces allow a family to live comfortably in a relatively compact home. </p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>After Solar Decathlon 2015, the SURE HOUSE will be delivered to a Jersey Shore town, where it will become a community outreach center and information resource. </p>

<h1>Team NY Alfred: State University of New York at Alfred College of Technology and Alfred University</h1>

<p>Team website: <a href="http://www.solardecathlon-alfred.org/">www.solardecathlon-alfred.org</a></p>

<p>Alf House, State University of New York at Alfred College of Technology and Alfred University's first U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon entry, was inspired by the rolling hills, deep valleys, and picturesque streams of Allegany County, New York. Alf House is designed to withstand the harsh winters of upstate New York and the stinginess of its sunshine. </p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>Alf House was designed for a small family in the Southern Tier of New York State with three goals in mind: efficiency, affordability, and simplicity. It is designed to be decoupled from a hectic, modern-day lifestyle, offering the owners a taste of quiet solitude and outdoor indulgences. Alf House intends to bring people together in a large, inviting, multipurpose space with scenic views. The central gathering space allows for ideal connectivity and interaction.</p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Structural insulated panels in the walls and roof reduce the cost and labor associated with installation of framed walls, provide a high R-value, and act as a structural member of the house.</li>

    <li>An energy recovery ventilator recycles hot air inside the house to produce cold air, and an air-conditioning unit acts as a high-performance chiller cooling the air-handling unit.</li>

    <li>An open floor plan—including a central gathering space made up of the living, kitchen, and dining areas—enhances the openness of the house while keeping the footprint under 1,000 ft2.</li>

    <li>A NanaWall system increases lighting and provides an egress to the porch.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The 11.5-kW, 46-panel solar photovoltaic system is designed with a low pitch that can be adjusted to fit different climates.</li>

    <li>The evacuated-tube collectors of the solar hot water system produce 13,500 Btuh of power and heat up 80 gallons of water in less than an hour during the day using a "dry" heat transfer method. </li>

    <li>An air handling unit and energy recovery ventilator recycle thermal energy inside the house and return it as clean cool air. </li>

    <li>A three-section hydronic radiant heat flooring system keeps the house warm and cozy for the cold winter season of rural New York.</li>
</ul>

INSERT VIDEO PLAYER



<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>Alf House is a unique space for a small family living in the hills, valleys, and woods of Allegany County. Allegany is a relatively rural, heavily wooded, and sparsely populated county in Western New York, about an hour and a half from Buffalo. A small family can fit comfortably within the house and take full advantage of nature through the large windows and a wrap-around porch.</p>

<p>The target client would be a trendsetter in the community. Although the Northeast is not known for excessive sun, solar panels placed at optimal angles would maximize what is available to sustain a zero-energy home. Many local farmers are interested in renewable ventures, and Alf House would give them a highly effective model. </p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>After Solar Decathlon 2015, the team plans to ship Alf House back Alfred for use as a learning laboratory or to donate it to the Alfred Habitat for Humanity. By using the house as a learning laboratory, students from the Alfred State Campus and Alfred University Campus will be able to modify and improve its features and base their senior projects on renewable technologies.</p>

<h1>Team Orange County: University of California, Irvine; Chapman University; Irvine Valley College; and Saddleback College</h1>

<p>Team website: <a href="http://www.teamoc2015.com/">www.teamoc2015.com/</a></p>

<p>Teaming up for their first U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon competition, the University of California, Irvine; Chapman University; Irvine Valley College; and Saddleback College have designed an innovative, net-zero-energy house that draws inspiration from the California state flower: the golden poppy. Like the flower, Casa Del Sol is drought-resistant and architecturally adapted to Southern California. It features an open design with a flex floor plan and separate studio for multigenerational living or a possible rental. </p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>Casa del Sol's architectural features—including a south-facing veranda, halo with retractable tensile structure, and eastern brise soleil—passively maintain a comfortable temperature by allowing sunlight into the house during the winter and providing shade from the sun during summer. Strategically positioned windows open to capture southwestern breezes. </p>

<p>Casa del Sol's conditioned space comes in at just under 1,000 ft2 and is mechanically managed by a radiant heating and cooling system coupled with rooftop solar thermal. Grey water is recycled and storm water is collected for use in the xeriscaped garden. An AC/DC bidirectional inverter allows the house to run on either electrical system, maximizes energy produced from solar panels, and makes Casa del Sol smart grid-ready. </p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A halo structure with an adjustable shading component above the outdoor living room regulates temperature and natural light while maintaining a comfortable environment in the most energy-efficient way possible.</li>

    <li>The grid-tied bidirectional AC/DC inverter saves energy and enables future smart grid integration. </li>

    <li>A hydromatic dryer uses solar thermal energy to supplement heating for the drum. </li>

    <li>The studio unit enables residents to comfortably house aging parents, returning college students, or an income-generating renter.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>To improve indoor air quality and the lifecycle of materials used, Team Orange County followed the Living Building Challenge's materials red list—a compilation of harmful-to-human chemicals and materials.</li>

    <li>To address California's drought, Casa del Sol incorporates greywater recycling systems in conjunction with rainwater catchment to irrigate the xersiscaped garden and provides occupants with fresh, organic produce year-round  through an aquaponic garden that requires 90% less water than traditional gardens.</li>

    <li>Operable windows, automated by an energy management control system, open and close according to weather patterns to maintain temperature without mechanical heating, ventilation and air conditioning.</li>

    <li>A personal 3-D printer and small-scale thermoplastic recycling system allows residents to break down printed objects that are no longer needed and reuse the material to generate new products such as household tools, creative decorations, and parts for simple home repairs. </li>
</ul>

INSERT VIDEO PLAYER



<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>Casa del Sol's private studio unit, with its own bathroom and kitchenette, can be used as supplemental living space for family members—a returning student, a grandparent, or an extended relative. Equipped with its own utilities, the studio can also be rented to economically support the homeowners.</p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>After Solar Decathlon 2015, Team Orange County hopes to find a local site where Casa del Sol can be maintained as a living laboratory to educate and engage the public in innovative approaches to sustainability. </p>

<h1>Texas/Germany: The University of Texas at Austin and Technische Universitaet Muenchen</h1>

<p>Team website: <a href="http://www.nexushaus.com/">www.nexushaus.com</a></p>

<p>Partnering across the world with Technische Universitaet Muenchen in Germany, The University of Texas at Austin returns to the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon in 2015 with a vision for its own backyard. One of the fastest growing cities in the U.S., Austin is facing strain on its water and electricity infrastructure. Compounding these issues is an increase in suburban poverty. The team's 784-ft2 NexusHaus offers a solution to these problems in a solar-powered house that can be deployed throughout Austin as an accessory dwelling unit. The house will collect most of its own water, provide vegetables and fish for consumption through a closed-loop aquaponics system, and increase density within Austin's single-family residential neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The University of Texas at Austin previously competed in <a href="/past/2002/team_texas.html">Solar Decathlon 2002</a>, <a href="/past/2005/team_texas.html">Solar Decathlon 2005</a>, and <a href="/past/2007/team_texas.html">Solar Decathlon 2007</a>.</p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>NexusHaus addresses sustainable and affordable urban housing in the context of energy and water resource constraints. This net zero-energy, zero-water capable house accomplishes these goals through a combination of photovoltaic electricity generation, integrated thermal/water storage systems, and cutting-edge smart home management. The design of NexusHaus considers environmental control factors unique to central Texas, including air circulation and solar heat gain from the intense summer sun. To address these issues, NexusHaus employs two design features typical in vernacular Texas architecture: the dog trot and a large covered deck on the south side. The ultimate goal of NexusHaus is to serve as a prototype for a next-generation modular home that could be reproduced en masse in an Austin assembly plant.</p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A rainwater catchment system will supply all potable water needs, allowing the house to connect to city water with only a small refill line for backup supply during dry spells.</li>

    <li>NexusHaus involves residents through a student-designed home management system that integrates traditionally separate home systems such as electricity, water, wastewater, smart appliances, indoor environmental monitoring and air conditioning, home occupancy and house security, interior and exterior lighting, home entertainment systems, and aquaponics and also serves as an educational tool to help residents live more sustainably.</li>

    <li>An Integrated Thermal Energy and Rainwater Storage (ITHERST) system shifts air-conditioning load to off-peak early morning hours to alleviate afternoon grid congestion and reduce power costs. </li>
</ul>

INSERT VIDEO PLAYER



<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>NexusHaus addresses three beneficiaries: the City of Austin, the property owner, and the resident. As an accessory dwelling unit, NexusHaus responds to Austin's skyrocketing demand for urban housing by adding density to established neighborhoods without requiring additional infrastructure. Austin's accessory dwelling unit code allows structures to be placed along existing alleys on more than 42,000 single-family residential lots. Many of these lots are located along public transportation routes, helping to also alleviate traffic. For the property owner, NexusHaus serves as a source of rental income to defray increasing property taxes. The NexusHaus resident target demographic places a premium on a location in a city where access to recreation and downtown is important.</p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>After Solar Decathlon 2015, NexusHaus will serve as a living and research unit at The University of Texas' McDonald Observatory. Locating the NexusHaus at McDonald Observatory will allow the team to monitor and study the performance of the house over a minimum of two years. </p>

<h1>U at Buffalo: University at Buffalo, The State University of New York</h1>

<p>Team website: <a href="http://grow.buffalo.edu/">www.grow.buffalo.edu</a></p>

<p>For its first U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, introduces the GRoW Home, which reconceptualizes sustainable urban living by pushing the conversation toward total self-sufficiency. This small but dynamic house adjusts to seasonal change through operable elements and a spatially flexible design that allows for adaptable living. The Growlarium—part greenhouse, part solarium—supports vegetation year-round and provides an extraordinary living space. </p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>The GRoW Home considers four key themes for sustainable residential design: nurture active stewardship, think functional flexibility, live with nature, and recognize energy hierarchy. Sited in Buffalo, a city characterized by relatively sunny, dry summers and mild swing seasons, the GRoW Home seeks to better connect the home owner with the natural environment. A tight thermal envelope encloses the conditioned living spaces to reduce heat loads in the winter, and an intermediary sun space (the Growlarium) changes aperture and program based on weather and user needs. </p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The building envelope employs structural insulated panels, two high-performance sliding glass doors, and a series of fixed superwindows to reduce heating loads.</li>

    <li>The Growlarium, a passively conditioned space, acts as a thermal buffer between the outside environment and the actively conditioned interior space and serves as a greenhouse during the winter.</li>

    <li>A canopy covers the enclosed portion of the house, serves as a trellis for plants, shades the house and deck to reduce cooling loads, and provides infrastructure for outdoor living items.</li>

    <li>Custom-designed furniture pieces fulfill added functions—such as providing thermal mass, drying food, and storing objects—in addition to their nominal roles as planters, benches, and tables. </li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The 7-kW, 24-panel PV system has a rated efficiency of 17.2% and, when installed after the competition in Buffalo, will produce 9 MWh per year—nearly twice as much energy as the house will consume.</li>

    <li>A four-zone variable-air-volume air-to-air mechanical system ensures maximum energy savings by only conditioning and distributing air on an as-needed basis to individual spaces within the house. </li>

    <li>"State of the shelf" ENERGY STAR® appliances reduce overall energy use.  </li>

    <li>A smart monitoring system oversees temperature, humidity, and electricity use and allows the resident to access the data via an online portal. </li>
</ul>

INSERT VIDEO PLAYER



<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>The GRoW Home is designed for a young, active, "cultural creative" urban gardening couple that seeks to reduce its dependency on large-scale food and power systems. As contributors to the revitalization of Buffalo, the clients will grow their own produce year-round and generate nearly twice as much electricity as they will consume.</p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>After the Solar Decathlon, the GRoW Home will return to Buffalo, where it will be installed permanently. In one potential scenario, the house would be installed at a site adjacent to the School of Architecture and Planning, where it would house a proposed Multi-Scalar Energy Research and Education Center. </p>

<ul>
    <li>A double-wide, factory-built house divided into northern and southern halves, Aggie Sol can be constructed and transported quickly and cost-effectively. </li>

    <li>Passive design techniques—including minimal use of windows, operable exterior window shades, and a light-colored exterior—reduce solar heat gain and cooling loads.</li>

    <li>The butterfly-sloped roof allows water to drain to a single valley, reducing the required gutters and simplifying rainwater collection. </li>

    <li>A secondary entry and cleansing room with shower and double-sided lockers provides farmworkers with an area to remove clothing contaminated with dirt or work-related debris and cleanse before entering the rest of the house. </li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Through the use of in-line framing, Aggie Sol uses 10% less lumber than houses built with conventional framing methods. </li>

    <li>A unique radiant cooling and heating system uses a large rainwater reservoir that is cooled by exposing the water to the air during the chilly night hours through a sprinkler system on the roof. The chilled water is then filtered and pumped through the radiant floor slab during the day to cool the house. </li>

    <li>A specialized heat exchanger extracts energy from grey water to preheat potable water for the domestic supply to recycle the latent energy effectively and quickly.</li>

    <li>Flexible reflective tubing from the roof leads sunlight inside, minimizing the energy needed to light the interior.</li>
</ul>

<h1>West Virginia/Rome: West Virginia University and University of Roma Tor Vergata</h1>

<p>Team website: <a href="http://solar.wvu.edu/">solar.wvu.edu</a></p>

<p>After joining forces for the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2013, West Virginia University and University of Roma Tor Vergata have partnered once again to present STILE—Sustainable Technologies Integrated in a Learning Experience. The focal design elements of STILE include recycled shipping containers and an arch that supports an array of solar panels and represents Italian and West Virginian architectural concepts. STILE employs a fully integrated automation system that teaches residents to efficiently use energy—enabling the house to truly serve as a learning experience.</p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>STILE's design combines intrinsic elements of Appalachian and Roman architecture. The concept is based on the formal opposition between the rectangular living area and the arch. This shape emphasizes minimalist design and creates a sealed inner space while allowing for interconnection with the outdoors. The living area is a large open space connected to the outside through a panoramic window wall, which creates a dynamic juxtaposition of interior and exterior. The arch combines the concepts of Roman architecture and the landscape of Appalachia while supporting a solar panel array.</p>

<p>STILE is separated into two regions: the public, mixed-use dining-living area and the private area. The mixed-use space demonstrates the deconstructionist concept. By removing the dividers that traditionally enclose rooms, the flow is enhanced and activities that may otherwise be restricted by the limited square footage are possible. </p>

<p>STILE uses deconstructed steel shipping containers for sustainability and to allow a portion of the house to be pre-assembled for quick and easy transportation and assembly. </p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>An arch provides structural support for solar panels and shade during the summer months, lowering cooling costs.</li>

    <li>Glass-wall windows along the southern half of the house slide open to connect with the outdoor environment, provide fresh air and passive conditioning, and allow sunlight to enter the interior.</li>

    <li>A solar chimney uses changes in air temperature and density to passively cool the house. </li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>An Overarching Automation and Security System helps residents reduce their carbon footprint and increase their quality of living through intuitive programming that learns their behavior to provide energy-efficient adjustments.</li>

    <li>A PV array of 36 285-W panels provides for all of STILE's electrical needs. </li>

    <li>Efficient, dimmable LEDs illuminate the house while conserving power. </li>
</ul>

INSERT VIDEO PLAYER



<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>The target client for STILE is a Baby Boomer couple whose children have left home and that is looking to downsize for economic and practical reasons. STILE offers an affordable, practical, and environmentally friendly home. </p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>After Solar Decathlon 2015, STILE will travel to the Tellus Science Museum. There, STILE will be put on exhibit to introduce museum visitors to sustainable sciences and modern movements in sustainable design. The exhibit will showcase the innovative architecture, mechanical systems, and energy efficiency technologies found in the house. </p>

<h1>Yale: Yale University</h1>

<p>Team website: <a href="http://yalesolardecathlon.com/">www.yalesolardecathlon.com</a></p>

<p>In August 2015, first-time team Yale University withdrew from the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon. The team's fundraising did not meet its expectations, which impacted its construction schedule. As a result, it was not able to finish its Y-House house in time for the competition. </p>

<p>"Yale is grateful for having had the opportunity to explore sustainable design through such an interdisciplinary format as the Solar Decathlon," said Edward Wang, a Yale University architecture student. "While Y-House will not be in Irvine to greet visitors this fall, we recognize that the pursuit of more sustainable living extends beyond the competition and plan to continue with Y-House's construction effort."</p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>Y-House seeks to find balance between home design that is sustainable, marketable to a younger generation, and focused on promoting an active lifestyle connected to the outdoors. An open façade and wide wood ramp create an entrance that encourages the public and occupants to mix. The large patio is ideally located for an outdoor living room. And because the house is designed for the mild Southern California climate, the patio draws occupants to enjoy its use. </p>

<p>Y-House is divided along two longitudinal axes. One half provides the main living spaces: living room, bedroom, and study—each connected to the exterior patio either physically or visually. The other is a service spine that contains the mechanical, electrical, and appliance equipment. The two modules enable design simplicity while ensuring ease of transportation and efficient, modular construction. </p>

INSERT PHOTO CAROUSEL



<h2>Features</h2>


<ul>
<li>The crux of the Y-House design is focused not on technologically advanced equipment but on the agglomeration of the combined design effort. </li>

    <li>The design minimizes the use of technology in an effort to ensure only truly necessary equipment is used. </li>

    <li>A small floor plan encourages occupants to maximize the use of the patio—blending interior and exterior zones and creating a breathable design that brings the exterior in and the interior out. </li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>


<ul>
<li>A unique solar thermal system of six collectors affixed to the back of a PV array acts as a heat sink and provides for the house's hot water requirements. </li>

    <li>Y-House is designed for natural ventilation as the preferred method of space conditioning. </li>

    <li>When natural ventilation is not feasible, a heat pump conditions and dehumidifies the house with minimum ductwork and energy consumption.</li>

<h1>Solar Decathlon Contests</h1>

<p>Like the Olympic decathlon, the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon consists of 10 contests. These contests are designed to gauge how well the houses perform and how livable and affordable they are. Each contest is worth a maximum of 100 points, for a competition total of 1,000 points.</p>

<p>Teams can earn points three ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Task completion</li>
</ul>

<p>Teams complete household tasks such as cooking, washing dishes, and doing laundry.</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitored performance</li>
</ul>

<p>Team houses perform to specified criteria, such as maintaining a comfortable (71°–76°F) indoor temperature range.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jury evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>Jurors who are experts in their field (such as architecture, engineering, and communications) award points for features that cannot be measured (such as aesthetics and design inspiration).</p>

<p>Contests based on task completion or monitored performance are called measured contests; contests based on jury evaluation are call juried contests.</p>

<h1>Energy Balance Contest</h1>

<p>(100 points)<br>
    The Energy Balance Contest of the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon is divided into two subcontests, energy production and energy consumption, each of which is worth 50 points.</p>

<p>For energy production, a team receives full points for producing at least as much energy as its house needs, thus achieving a net energy consumption of zero during the competition. Reduced points are earned for a net electrical energy balance between -50 kWh and 0 kWh. </p>

<p>For energy consumption, a team receives full points for using 175 kWh of energy or less over the competition. Reduced points are earned for consumption between 175 kWh and 300 kWh. </p>
