<h1>How To Apply for the Solar Decathlon</h1>

<p>Is your school or organization interested in participating in the next U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon? Find out what you need to know to apply below.</p>

<h2>Solar Decathlon 2017 Collegiate Teams</h2>

<p>The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency  and Renewable Energy (EERE) is inviting collegiate teams of creative designers  and innovators to enter the Solar Decathlon 2017 College Team Competition. For  the first time in a Solar Decathlon competition, DOE intends to offer monetary  prizes. For Solar Decathlon 2017, DOE will award up to $2,000,000 in prizes to  teams that are selected to participate and bring an eligible house to the Solar  Decathlon competition. The prizes will be awarded to the same 20 lead  organizational entities that submit applications to DOE under this competition,  are selected by DOE to compete, and complete a house for the Solar Decathlon.  Recipients will receive no federal funding up front but will be eligible for  prize money upon completion of the competition. </p>

<p>The competition is open to all collegiate teams in the  United States and around the world, but the focus is on design solutions for  the United States.</p>

<p>For more information, see the full funding opportunity  announcement, <a href="https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/Default.aspx?Search=decathlon&SearchType=#FoaId7a43edea-d90c-46f2-b6ce-9adda347e64a">DE-FOA-0001398:  2017 Solar Decathlon College Team Competition</a>, on the EERE Funding  Opportunity Exchange website. All questions should be directed to <a href="mailto:2017SolarDecathlonCompetition@ee.doe.gov">2017SolarDecathlonCompetition@ee.doe.gov</a>. </p>

<h2>Solar Decathlon Program Administrator</h2>

<p>DOE's EERE also seeks applicants to its Solar Decathlon  Program Administrator funding opportunity announcement. DOE intends to select  one recipient to organize, manage, and conduct the Solar Decathlon competitions  in 2017 and 2019. This includes identifying and providing the competition  location/venue, soliciting sponsorships, hosting the competitions, awarding  prize money to the competitors, and promoting the mission and goals of DOE's EERE  through educational programs and outreach. A key near-term requirement will be  to identify a new location/venue for the 2017 Solar Decathlon.</p>
