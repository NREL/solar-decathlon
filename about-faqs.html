<p>The U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon challenges collegiate teams to design, build, and operate solar-powered houses that are affordable, energy-efficient, and attractive. The winner of the competition is the team that best blends cost-effectiveness, consumer appeal, and design excellence with optimal energy production and maximum efficiency. </p>

<p>The first Solar Decathlon was held in <a href="/past/2002/">2002</a>; the competition has since occurred biennially in <a href="/past/2005/">2005</a>, <a href="/past/2007/">2007</a>, <a href="/past/2009/">2009</a>, <a href="/past/2011/">2011</a>, and <a href="/past/2013/">2013</a>. The next Solar Decathlon will take place in October 2015 at the Orange County Great Park in Irvine, California. <a href="/about-apply.html">Plan your visit</a>. </p>

<p><a href="/2015/competition-teams.html">Teams</a> from colleges and universities across the globe participate in the Solar Decathlon. Today's students are tomorrow's engineers, architects, scientists, entrepreneurs, and homeowners. The Solar Decathlon encourages students to incorporate energy efficiency and clean energy into their future professional projects and personal lives.</p>

<p>Like Olympic athletes, the solar decathletes draw on all their strengths, including design and architecture, engineering and performance, and education and promotion. The teams rely on expertise from many disciplines as they spend months fundraising, planning, designing, analyzing, and finally building and improving their houses. Future engineers work with future architects to create affordable, energy-efficient houses.</p>

<p>Teams composed of faculty and students from post-secondary institutions submit proposals and plans for consideration. Applications are evaluated by a panel of engineers, scientists, and building experts. Teams are required to meet specific criteria to demonstrate their ability to design and build an innovative, entirely solar-powered house; raise funds; support the project through well-integrated curricula; and assemble a team to carry the project through to completion. In addition, a panel of professionals evaluates conceptual designs from proposers. The results of their evaluations, combined with scores based on the four criteria listed above, determine the Solar Decathlon teams.</p>

<p>The student teams spend almost two years designing and building their houses and preparing for the competition. Students test their houses to ensure optimal energy production and maximum efficiency. </p>

<p>The competition places demands on the buildings' energy systems to maintain the house within a certain temperature range, to provide lighting, to run appliances, and much more. The houses generate energy with photovoltaic (also called solar electric) systems that produce electricity and with solar thermal systems for space heating and cooling and water heating. </p>

<p>The construction costs of the team houses vary based on the technologies employed and the target market for which they were designed. In 2011, the Solar Decathlon introduced a new contest—Affordability—that rewards full points for teams that build houses with costs estimated at or less than $250,000. In this way, the Solar Decathlon showcases affordable houses that combine energy-efficient construction and appliances with renewable energy systems available today.</p>

<p>Some of the houses are sold to recover costs or raise money for future teams. Most of the houses, however, are used for research and are on display for <a href="/house-tours.html">public tours</a> at their respective universities.
