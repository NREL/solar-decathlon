<h1>Participant Registration</h1>

        <p>Long-term  access (from assembly through disassembly) to the U.S. Department of Energy  Solar Decathlon 2015 site is prohibited without proper registration. <!--To begin  registration, first review the instructions below and then click the  &quot;Register&quot; button at the bottom of the page to access the online  registration site. </p>

        <p>Registration  is by invitation only. To register, you will need the invitation code provided  in your official Yahoo Group message invitation.<br>-->

        <p>Online registration is now closed. To register, please visit the Registration Tent onsite.</p>

        <p>Please  note: Each participant must register individually. There are no group  registrations. Registrations are subject to verification.</p>

        <h2>Registration Types</h2>
        <p>Solar  Decathlon registration categories (per the <a href="rules.html">Solar Decathlon 2015 Rules</a>) are described below. If  you are not sure which category to use, contact the <a href="mailto:Pamela.Gray.Hann@nrel.gov">registration official</a>.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Team Member </strong><br>
        <p>An enrolled  student, recent graduate, faculty member, or other person affiliated with a participating  school and integrally involved with a team's project activities is a team  member. Decathletes, faculty advisors, and team crew are all considered team  members.</p>

        <p>Note: With the exception of team crew, all  team members must be prepared to show verification (e.g., student IDs or  documents indicating they are recent graduates) that they are eligible to be  team members. </p>

        <p>Participating students may  be considered Decathletes if <a href="/2015/assets/pdfs/2015-eligibility.pdf">eligibility criteria</a> are met. Decathletes  must be prepared to provide verification of eligibility. With this verification, you will receive a  special Decathlete wristband (issued just prior to start of competition week). </p>

        <p>A team crew person is a team member who is  involved with a team's project but who may be unaffiliated with a participating  school; contractors, volunteers, team media, and sponsors are team crew  examples. The Team Crew category is mainly intended for people who will be on  site for a short period of time during assembly and disassembly.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Organizer</strong><br>
        <p>An  Organizer is a Department of Energy or National Renewable Energy Laboratory  employee, subcontractor, juror, or observer working on the project. The Juror  and Observer classifications are restricted to those invited by the Director or  Competition Manager to fill those roles.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Staff</strong><br>
        <p>Staff includes individuals working for the Organizers  whose role is not described above. Examples of staff are Volunteer Coordination  staff, Orange County Great Park staff, and others not directly under a  subcontract with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>NREL Employee</strong><br>
        <p>This registration type  is only for employees of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.</p>

        </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Required Documents and Forms</h2>
        <p>The information requested in the Waiver of Liability, Emergency Medical  Release, and Parental Consent forms will be captured through the registration  site. The following documents will give you an example of the information  contained in each document and can be used if you have trouble with the registration  site.</p>

<p>*  Verification for team members will be a Student ID or document showing that you  are a currently enrolled in or a recent graduate of your school. <br>
** Verification  for Decathletes must follow the Decathlete <a href="/2015/assets/pdfs/2015-eligibility.pdf">Eligibility Rules</a> (see the eligibility  criteria).<br>
***  According to the <a href="/2015/assets/pdfs/2015_rules.pdf">Solar  Decathlon Rules</a> (Section 3.3. Safety), those under 18 at the start of the  event (Sept. 28, 2015) are not allowed onsite during assembly or disassembly.</p>

<p>To submit  the required documents/forms: </p>
<ul>
        <li>Complete your registration through the  online registration site, accessed by clicking the "Register" button at the bottom of this page.</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
        <li>If you have trouble with the online  site or miss the online registration deadline of Sept. 7, 2015, then download the forms from the  above chart. E-mail the completed forms to the <a href="mailto:Pamela.Gray.Hann@nrel.gov">Registration Official</a> or bring them with you to onsite registration.</li>
        <li>For the Emergency Medical Release form,  another option is to use the <a href="/2015/assets/pdfs/sd2015_medical_release_form.pdf">fillable PDF</a>. Adobe Reader 9 or higher  is required to complete and submit this fillable form. Mac users should not use  Preview to try to complete the form. If you experience problems viewing the PDF  from your browser, download the PDF (right-click on the link and choose "Save  Link As") and open in Adobe Reader 9 (or higher) to complete it. Note that Chrome's PDF  plugin may not load the form within the browser window. Try a different  browser or use the download option above.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Event ID Photo Requirements</h2>
<p>At  onsite registration, you will receive an event ID that permits you access to  the Solar Decathlon site. In most cases, the ID will include a photo, which should  be submitted as part of online registration. These photos must:</p>

<ul type="disc">
    <li>Be color</li>
    <li>Be taken within the last 6 months </li>
    <li>Be taken in front of a plain white or off-white background</li>
    <li>Be taken in full-face view directly facing the camera with no hats or sunglasses</li>
    <li>Be in a square aspect ratio so that the height is equal to the width (Minimum acceptable dimensions are 600 x 600 pixels; maximum acceptable dimensions are 1200 x 1200 pixels.)</li>
    <li>Be in JPG format</li>
    <li>Not be selfies.</li>
</ul>


<p>The <a href="mailto:pamela.gray.hann@nrel.gov">Registration Official</a> will reject your photo if it does not meet these standards.</p>

<p>If  your photo has not been received by Sept. 7, you must bring an <em>electronic</em> passport-style photo with you  (on a USB drive). No photos will be taken by registration staff. If you plan to  pick up your event ID at the All-Team Meeting (Sept. 27), you <em>must</em> have completed  your registration by Sept. 7. Because of the large number of event participants  who pick up IDs at the All-Team Meeting, we may not be able to process your ID  during this time if all the requirements have not been met (exception is the  Decathlete Eligibility requirements, which are not due until closer to the  start of competition week).</p>


<h2>Helpful Hints</h2>
<p>Past  Solar Decathlon teams have found efficient ways to complete their  registrations. Here are a few hints:</p>

<ul type="disc">
    <li>Put one person in charge of encouraging people to register. </li>
    <li>Create a spreadsheet to track who has completed their online registration, including photos and Decathlete Eligibility documentation (if available before Sept. 7 and if applicable).</li>
    <li>Contact the <a href="mailto:pamela.gray.hann@nrel.gov">Registration Official</a> to confirm the status of your team's registration.</li>
    <li>Set up a photo shoot day when all team members have their photos taken. This gives a uniform look to all photos. Have team members wear their team uniforms.</li>
</ul>
