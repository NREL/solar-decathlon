                <p>Stevens Institute of Technology started with a simple question when preparing for the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2015: "How can we design a home that both reduces energy use and adapts to the realities of a changing, more extreme climate?" The answer is the SURE (sustainable + resilient) HOUSE, a high-performance, solar-powered house that is armored against extreme weather and can provide emergency power in the aftermath of a storm—packaged as a comfortable, beautiful shore house.</p>

                <p>Stevens Institute of Technology previously competed in <a href="/past/2011/team_parsons_stevens.html">Solar Decathlon 2011</a> and <a href="/past/2013/team_stevens.html">Solar Decathlon 2013</a>.   </p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>The storm surge, high winds, and flooding associated with 2012's Superstorm Sandy highlighted the vulnerability of Mid-Atlantic shore neighborhoods. The SURE HOUSE therefore began with a simple idea: create a low-energy, solar-powered, storm-resilient home for vulnerable coastal communities. The notion of the "shore house" resulted in a focus on indoor-outdoor spaces, and through a simple design transformation, the SURE HOUSE doubles its usable space in the summer months by opening up to the outdoor decks. This outdoor living room complements a contemporary interior that draws on natural daylight and flexible living space to create an inviting family home.</p>

<p>The SURE HOUSE is based on three principles: use less energy through smart design, generate all energy needed through renewable solar electric, and be capable of providing power during electrical outages. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A storm-rugged PV system supplies power when in the grid is down without the use of batteries. </li>

    <li>Working with local topography such as dunes, the SURE HOUSE can be raised slightly to avoid periodic nuisance flooding and encapsulate vital building systems in a storm-resistant shell. </li>

    <li>Thick insulation and rigorous air-sealing mean the SURE HOUSE is less sensitive to outdoor temperature swings and remains clean, safe, healthy, and comfortable inside.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>An "islanding" PV array produces energy even when the utility grid is damaged or disconnected, powering the house and allowing neighbors to charge their electronic devices via exterior USBs.</li>

    <li>The SURE HOUSE exceeds Passive House standards for energy use through the use of dense insulation, rigorous air sealing, smart construction techniques, and high-performance windows, </li>

    <li>Architecturally integrated, fiber-composite shutters on the southern façade provide passive solar control and house integrated PV panels when up and lock into the structure with a watertight seal when down. </li>

    <li>A hybrid heat pump hot water tank accepts DC power directly from the PV system to allow it to function without grid power.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>The New York and New Jersey shores are home to tight-knit neighborhoods of residents who represent the target market for the SURE HOUSE. Designed with a middle-class family in mind, the SURE HOUSE represents a new direction in living for coastal shore housing by providing a safe, secure, comfortable, and architecturally innovative home. The two bedrooms and flexible living spaces allow a family to live comfortably in a relatively compact home. </p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>After Solar Decathlon 2015, the SURE HOUSE will be delivered to a Jersey Shore town, where it will become a community outreach center and information resource. </p>
