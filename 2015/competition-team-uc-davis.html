<p>For its first U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon, the University of California, Davis, has created Aggie Sol, a prototype zero-net-energy home for the underserved farmworkers of America. </p>

<p>The two-bedroom, one-bathroom Aggie Sol is factory-built for easy transportation and construction. Its contains a large common space with living, kitchen, and dining rooms that open onto the decks and sleeping and service rooms off a hallway. The house features in-line framing and an innovative radiant floor system that uses the night sky to reduce cooling loads. </p>



<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>UC Davis' goal is to design an affordable zero-net-energy house that provides comfort, safety, and a better quality of life for farm workers and other underserved communities. The design addresses health, living, and cost concerns—including inadequate heating and cooling, poor air quality, work-related debris, and affordability—associated with farmworker housing conditions at a price that public and private housing providers can afford. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A double-wide, factory-built house divided into northern and southern halves, Aggie Sol can be constructed and transported quickly and cost-effectively. </li>

    <li>Passive design techniques—including minimal use of windows, operable exterior window shades, and a light-colored exterior—reduce solar heat gain and cooling loads.</li>

    <li>The butterfly-sloped roof allows water to drain to a single valley, reducing the required gutters and simplifying rainwater collection. </li>

    <li>A secondary entry and cleansing room with shower and double-sided lockers provides farmworkers with an area to remove clothing contaminated with dirt or work-related debris and cleanse before entering the rest of the house. </li>
</ul>




<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Through the use of in-line framing, Aggie Sol uses 10% less lumber than houses built with conventional framing methods. </li>

    <li>A unique radiant cooling and heating system uses a large rainwater reservoir that is cooled by exposing the water to the air during the chilly night hours through a sprinkler system on the roof. The chilled water is then filtered and pumped through the radiant floor slab during the day to cool the house. </li>

    <li>A specialized heat exchanger extracts energy from grey water to preheat potable water for the domestic supply to recycle the latent energy effectively and quickly.</li>

    <li>Flexible reflective tubing from the roof leads sunlight inside, minimizing the energy needed to light the interior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Market Strategy</h2>

<p>Aggie Sol's target market is underserved communities and their housing providers.  The house design strives to meet the needs of underserved communities and provide a beautiful, functional, sustainable, and affordable zero-net-energy home. Designed with farmworkers in mind, the Aggie Sol accommodates large gatherings and promotes a clean living space. Team Aggie Sol gives low-income communities the opportunity to live in a comfortable, beautiful home that they can afford.</p>



<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>After Solar Decathlon 2015, the UC Davis team plans to permanently locate Aggie Sol on campus for student housing, where it would serve as a long-term case study. In addition, the team is working with its sponsors and business school to determine how the design can best be implemented in the housing market.</p>
